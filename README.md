# ChatApplication
This is a web-based chat application where users can login using their mail-id and can chat among themselves.

When you initially use this chat application in your browser, a signup form is displayed. You must fill out this form by providing your name, email address, password, 
and profile picture. The email and picture fields are both completely validated, so you may only input a genuine email address and an image file. 

After that, a OTP will be sent to your registered mail id, you should submit this OTP, if the OTP is validated to be true, then you will be redirected to the users page.

If you are already registered person, then you can login with your username and password, you will be redirected to the users page.
There also available a option of forgot password, incase if the user forgotten the password. An OTP will be sent to the users's registered mail id, which should be 
entered to change the password.

Once you've successfully signed up, you'll be led to the user's page, where you can see your complete name, image, status, and logout button at the top and users who are 
similar to you who have joined up at the bottom.

You can view their picture, name, status, and any recent messages they have sent to you on this page. You must click on the specific user, or you may use the search bar 
to look up any existing user by name, and you will be redirected to the chat page, where you can view the individual's image, name, and status.

When you send a message to another user, that message is immediately visible in both your chat box and the recipient's chat box. This user received the message with the 
sender image in the chatbox where messages are received. Take into consideration that once the chatbox starts scrolling, it will do so automatically. Anytime you log out 
of the chat application, all other users will immediately be informed that you have gone offline or are logged out.
